# Privacy Policy for Our Discord Bot

**Effective Date:** June 12, 2024

Welcome to our Discord bot's Privacy Policy. This document explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you interact with our bot. By using our bot, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Messages
Our bot processes messages in the following ways:
- **Trigger Words:** When a message starts with "WFL" or "W/F/L", our bot reacts with the emojis: ðŸ‡¼, ðŸ‡«, and ðŸ‡±.

### 1.2 Planned Features
- **Message Blacklist System:** In the future, we will add a feature to blacklist specific messages. This feature will allow us to identify and block certain words or phrases.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

### 2.1 Current Features
- **Reacting to Messages:** When you send a message that starts with "WFL" or "W/F/L", our bot will automatically react with the specified emojis. This processing is done in real-time, and the messages are not stored or logged.

### 2.2 Planned Features
- **Message Blacklist System:** This feature will allow us to block specific words or phrases. Details on how messages are processed and handled will be updated in this policy once the feature is implemented.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

### 3.1 Message Handling
- **Real-Time Processing:** Messages processed for emoji reactions are handled in real-time on our servers. We do not store or log these messages. Once the message is processed and the reaction is applied, the data is immediately discarded.

### 3.2 Data Storage
- **No External Storage:** We do not store any data outside of Discord. All message processing and handling are conducted on our servers, and we do not retain any user data after processing.

### 3.3 Security Measures
We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 4. Third-Party Services

Our bot does not currently share any collected information with third-party services. If this changes, we will update this policy to reflect the new practices.

## 5. User Control and Data Deletion

### 5.1 User Control
Users can control their interactions with our bot by choosing not to use the specific trigger phrases or commands that activate the botâ€™s features.

### 5.2 Data Deletion
Since our bot does not store any data, there is no data to delete. If you have concerns about specific messages, please reach out to our support team through our Discord server.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
